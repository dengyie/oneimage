# Project State

## Objective

Maintain OneImage as a browser-first image workbench and keep its provenance path deployable through GitHub Actions to pxed.

## Current Phase

Provenance target fix implemented and locally verified; deployment pending.

## Current Branch

`main` is at `223aed4`, deployed to pxed. The current uncommitted fix makes provenance inspect the
current edited result, clears stale evidence after new output, and labels C2PA/SynthID separately
from visible watermark detection.

## Last Verified

2026-10-20 Asia/Shanghai: 84 tests, TypeScript, frontend/server builds pass. GitHub Actions
`39319023474` verify/package/deploy-pxed succeeded; pxed revision matches and oneimage/nginx are
RUNNING. Public health/capabilities returned 200. Public browser QA confirms crop resize/move,
32px hit targets, 400x300 PNG mosaic preview/export with unchanged outside pixels, 390px mobile fit,
and no browser exceptions.

2026-10-21 Asia/Shanghai: provenance regression verified locally: first request uses `original.png`,
after export the second request uses an `edited` filename, and the old evidence card is cleared.
Full test/build/deploy and public verification are pending.
Earlier the same day: 84 tests, TypeScript, frontend/server builds pass. Browser QA confirms
desktop crop resize/move, native touch resize with 32px target, 390px mobile fit, mosaic blocks in
preview and full-resolution PNG export, outside-mask pixel preservation, and mosaic undo/redo/reset.

2026-10-19 Asia/Shanghai: 82 tests, TypeScript, frontend/server builds pass. Browser QA confirms
global/local slider targeting, local-on-global pixel composition, same-file reset, current-editor
input into compress tool (`200x120` retained), and 390px mobile without horizontal overflow.
Actions `39193251326` verify/package/deploy-pxed all succeeded. Public health/capabilities returned
200; 320x180 PNG rotation/local sharpening/WebP export produced 180x320; 390px mobile had no
horizontal overflow or browser exceptions.

2026-10-18 Asia/Shanghai: smoke-test found a preview aspect-ratio display bug; fix `5137eb7` deployed
through Actions run `39121790162` (verify/package/deploy-pxed all green). Passed 81 OneImage tests,
TypeScript, frontend build, and local browser check. Public smoke: pxed revision matches;
Supervisor/Nginx RUNNING; health/capabilities 200; valid PNG upload, 1:1 crop overlay measured at
ratio 1.0, local region/sharpen/rotate/mirror/export passed; 390px mobile has no horizontal overflow;
no browser exceptions.

Earlier 2026-10-15 Asia/Shanghai: Online smoke test of production `image.mangoqwq.com` (release `d3dad4c`).
Passed: `/healthz` 200; `/api/v1/capabilities` 200 (`provenance.enabled=true`, provider `openai`,
`maxInputBytes=26214400`); JSON error envelope for non-multipart, signature/MIME mismatch, and AVIF
input (all `400 invalid-input`); happy path JPEG/PNG/WebP return `200` with real C2PA and SynthID
evidence; the per-client limiter returns `429` after 30 requests in a window (verified on the origin
and through nginx). Failed: uploads above roughly 200 KB over Cloudflare are throttled to ~60-90 KB/s
and end in a Cloudflare `502` or a client timeout. The app itself is fast (12 MB in ~5 s on loopback)
and nginx locally is fast (5 MB in ~2 s), so the constraint is the Cloudflare->origin tunnel leg.

Earlier: Actions run `38632226498` verify/package/deploy all succeeded for the rate-limiter and tool-contract fixes (`3a31e16`, `70ea40e`). 56 local tests pass, gateway 25/25.

Earlier the same day: Actions run `38621428349` verify/package/deploy all succeeded for two post-review commits (`69d4572` dead-code removal, `22b19a8` shared input-format policy). tsc, frontend build, server build, and 46 local tests pass. Live `image.mangoqwq.com`: `/healthz` 200, PNG upload passes the MIME gate to the provider, AVIF upload returns `400 invalid-input`.

## Active Risks

- OpenAI key is intentionally retained as a dedicated test key per owner instruction; rotate before production use.
- AI image generation provider, pricing, quota, and policy selection remain P1 product work.
- Large uploads through the Cloudflare tunnel to pxed are throttled (~60-90 KB/s) and fail with `502`
  above a few hundred KB. App and nginx are both fast locally, so this is host/tunnel-side and outside
  the repo-only change scope.
- The repository Nginx template now uses `client_max_body_size 26m` and forwards the Cloudflare client
  address; pxed was already updated to the same body limit during the prior smoke-test repair.
- The OneImage app's stdout is not captured on pxed: `fd 1` is a pipe and `out.log` has been frozen
  since 2026-10-15 08:53 +0800, so request logs are unavailable (host-side observability gap; the pipe
  could eventually fill and block the process).
- The pxed release parent (`/personal/pxed/oneimage`) is on NFS with a quota that can fail at `close(2)`;
  the receiver keeps the Supervisor entrypoint (`$root/run.sh`) as an atomic symlink, cleans stale
  temporary symlinks, and excludes active `current`/entrypoint releases from retention cleanup.

## Active Blockers

None for the current P0 deployment milestone.

## Current Focus

Select and contract-test the first AI image generation provider with explicit cost and quota controls.

## Next Milestone

Select and contract-test the first AI image generation provider with explicit cost and quota controls.

## Key Artifacts

- Production: `https://image.mangoqwq.com`
- Server: `/personal/pxed/oneimage`, Supervisor program `oneimage`
- Gateway package: `providers/content-provenance-gateway/` at v3 baseline `f6b4a23`
- Canonical docs: `01.项目/OneImage/OneImage 文档索引.md`, `01.项目/OneImage/OneImage 开发文档.md`

# OneImage

OneImage is a local-first image workbench. P0 tools run in the browser and do not upload the source image. Remote AI and provenance providers are isolated behind server-side adapters so browser code never receives provider secrets.

## Current implementation

- Browser tools: format conversion, compression, resize, visible watermark, metadata-clean export; processing prefers a module Worker with an OffscreenCanvas path and keeps a browser fallback.
- Domain contracts: `ToolRegistry` and deterministic local job state machine.
- Provider boundary: `OpenAIProvenanceAdapter` maps C2PA and SynthID evidence independently.
- Server boundary: `POST /api/v1/provenance/openai` accepts one bounded multipart image, streams it through a private temporary file, and keeps `OPENAI_API_KEY` server-side.
- Operations boundary: `GET /healthz` returns `200` when the provider is configured and `503` degraded status otherwise, without exposing secrets. It checks configuration, not upstream connectivity.
- AI image generation (text-to-image): server-side provider adapters (`openai-images` for OpenAI `gpt-image-*` / xAI `grok-2-image*` / OpenAI-compatible aggregators, `gemini` for direct Google `generateContent`). Providers are configured only on the server via `ONEIMAGE_IMAGE_PROVIDERS_FILE` (or inline `ONEIMAGE_IMAGE_PROVIDERS` JSON) with `baseUrl`, `apiKey` and the model list; the browser sees provider names and models through `GET /api/v1/imagegen/capabilities` and never a key or URL. `POST /api/v1/imagegen` is rate-limited per client and bounded by a durable daily cap (`ONEIMAGE_IMAGEGEN_DAILY_CAP`, default 20/day per client). Results land in the workbench for further editing.
- UI: responsive workbench with local preview, drag-and-drop input, cancellation, export, and privacy status.

OCR, segmentation, upscaling, invisible watermark operations, and remote inpainting remain gated behind the validation probes in the project development document. They are not represented as silently working features.

## Run

```powershell
npm install
npm test
npm run build
npm run server
npm run dev
```

The production build is static. Run the Fastify adapter separately with `npm run server`; it bundles a CommonJS Node entrypoint before starting, defaults to `127.0.0.1:8787` locally, and reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` server-side. The pxed deployment sets `PORT=8877` in its private `.env`. Vite proxies `/api` to that local server during development. Configure `NODE_ENV=development` explicitly to allow the no-token same-origin development proxy. Production and unset environments require `ONEIMAGE_SERVER_TOKEN` or an equivalent authenticated reverse-proxy session. Do not import the adapter into browser UI code or expose that key to the client.

For constrained environments, set `ONEIMAGE_SERVER_BUILD_DIR` to a writable directory before `npm run server:build`; otherwise the build uses the system temporary directory and produces `index.cjs`.

The production Nginx example under `deploy/` listens on loopback port `3302`, proxies `/api/` to Fastify on `8877`, and serves the static build for `image.mangoqwq.com`. Its token include is host-only at `/personal/pxed/nginx/oneimage-secret.conf` (outside the globally included `conf.d` directory), mode `0600`, and never part of a release archive. GitHub Actions expects `PXED_DEPLOY_KEY`, `PXED_KNOWN_HOSTS`, and `PXED_DEPLOY_HOST` in the `production` environment; the deploy key must be restricted to the fixed receiver command. Keep the Cloudflare Tunnel catch-all ingress last when adding this hostname.

## Provenance gateway package

`providers/content-provenance-gateway/` is a self-contained package in this
monorepo: a small, separately deployable Node service that exposes OpenAI's
`POST /v1/content_provenance_checks` as an **anonymous** endpoint (the upstream
key stays server-side, with per-IP rate limiting, a daily cost cap, a concurrency
limit, and a body-size cap).

It is included as a self-contained reference for the provenance data source and is
deployed independently; OneImage does not depend on it at runtime. A normal clone
contains the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dengyie/oneimage.git
```
